This can take around 5 days. But trust me, worth the wait!♥<br>
### **4. Download and extract the files**<br>
Once your data is ready to download, you'll get an email with a link to download a .ZIP file. You need to extract this file before proceeding. You can learn how to extract .ZIP files [on this page]<br>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAFwU2BQwHE).<br>
